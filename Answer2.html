            <h1>Path of the Crisper Drawer</h1>
            <p>
                Your hand delves into the depths, grasping the firm object.
                Triumphantly, you pull out...a petrified zucchini.
                But the jungle of soggy greens has turned sentient.
                You narrowly escape being consumed by the <b>Crisper Colony</b>.
                Perhaps next time, youâ€™ll just order takeout.
            </p>
